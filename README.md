# Triple Triad AI

This repository contains tools to play with the [Triple Triad Card Game](https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/contentsguide/goldsaucer/tripletriad/).
You can currently:
- See an AI (Negamax with Prunning) play optimally VS a Random algorithm.
- Use OCR to recognize cards from a picture into their in-game values.
- Use OCR, to take a picture of a board, and extract the cards available to the left player before the game starts.

## Examples:
### Game simulation
Changing `should_simulate_game` from `True` to `False` and running `python -m main` will play a game and display the board state:

### Card recognition
Changing `should_try_recognize_card` from `True` to `False` and running `python -m main` will display an image like this one:

### Board trimming into card recognition
Changing `should_try_recognize_board` from `True` to `False` and running `python -m main` will display an image like this one:

## Code modifications:
Command lines parameters are currently not handled, but you can manually modify `main.py` to access different logic of the code.
- You can change `should_simulate_game` to see how the **Negamax** algorithm plays against a **random** algorithm
- You can change `should_try_recognize_card` to see how the algorithm tries to recognize cards based on pre-trimmed screenshots
- You can change `should_try_recognize_board` to recognize cards for the player on the left for a screenshot that contains a triple triad empty board (before any move was made).
