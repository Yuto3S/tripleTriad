# tripleTriad
Triple Triad Game, inspired from FFXIV

Current version contains the skeleton of the game, where the cards to play must be defined in main.py
Using ```board.display()``` in that code allows to get an UI of the current board state, generated by OpenCV. 

Future versions will include a smarter AI to play against and more features :)
